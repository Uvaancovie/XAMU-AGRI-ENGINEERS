## 1. Functional Requirements

Functional requirements define the specific behaviors and functions of the system.

| ID | Requirement | Description |
|---|---|---|
| **FR-01** | User Authentication | Users must be able to log in with an email and password. The system shall verify credentials against the Firebase Authentication service. |
| **FR-02** | Client Management | Authenticated users shall be able to create, view, and list client information (company name, contact person, etc.). |
| **FR-03** | Project Management | Users shall be able to create new projects associated with a specific client and view a list of all projects. |
| **FR-04** | Note Taking | Users must be able to create, save, and view timestamped text notes with GPS coordinates for a specific project. |
| **FR-05** | Route Tracking | The system shall allow users to start, stop, and save a GPS route, capturing a series of location points over time. |
| **FR-06** | Photo Upload | Users must be able to upload photos from their device's camera or gallery, add an optional caption, and associate them with a project. |
| **FR-07** | Weather View | The app shall display the current weather conditions (temperature, condition, wind) for the user's current GPS location. |
| **FR-08** | Offline Access | All core data capture functions (notes, routes, photos) must be available when the device is offline. |
| **FR-09** | Data Synchronization | The app must automatically synchronize all locally stored data with the backend services (Firebase/Cloudinary) when an internet connection becomes available. |

## 2. Non-Functional Requirements

Non-functional requirements define the quality attributes of the system.

| ID | Category | Requirement |
|---|---|---|
| **NFR-01** | Performance | The app must load and become responsive within 3 seconds on a mid-range Android device. All UI transitions should be smooth (60fps). |
| **NFR-02** | Security | All communication between the app and backend services must be encrypted using HTTPS. Sensitive data like API keys must not be stored in the source code. |
| **NFR-03** | Usability | The user interface must be intuitive and follow standard Android Material Design guidelines. New users should be able to perform core tasks without training. |
| **NFR-04** | Reliability | The application must have an uptime of 99.9% and should not crash or lose data during normal operation. |
| **NFR-05** | Scalability | The backend infrastructure must be able to support at least 1,000 concurrent users without significant performance degradation. |
| **NFR-06** | Maintainability | The codebase must be well-documented, with clear separation of concerns to allow for easy maintenance and future development. |
