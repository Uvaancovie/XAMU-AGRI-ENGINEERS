# Change Management Strategy

This document outlines the change management strategy for the Xamu Wetlands field app. The goal is to ensure that all changes are introduced in a controlled and coordinated manner, minimizing disruption and maximizing user adoption.

## 1. Communication Plan

- **Release Notes**: Every new release will be accompanied by clear and concise release notes, detailing the new features, bug fixes, and any changes to existing functionality.
- **User Training**: For major feature releases, we will provide short training videos or online sessions to demonstrate the new functionality.
- **Feedback Channel**: We will maintain a dedicated feedback channel (e.g., a specific email address or a form) where users can report issues, ask questions, and suggest improvements.

## 2. Release & Rollout Strategy

- **Semantic Versioning**: We will follow the [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) standard (e.g., 1.0.0) for all releases.
- **Phased Rollouts**: Major updates will be rolled out in phases, starting with a small group of pilot users. This allows us to gather feedback and identify any issues before a full-scale release.
- **Hotfixes**: Critical bug fixes will be released as hotfixes as soon as they are ready.

## 3. Stakeholder Involvement

- **Regular Demos**: We will conduct bi-weekly demos to showcase the latest developments and gather feedback from key stakeholders.
- **User Acceptance Testing (UAT)**: Before any major release, a group of representative users will perform UAT to ensure that the new features meet their needs and are free of critical bugs.
