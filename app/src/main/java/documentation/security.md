# Security Considerations

This document outlines the security measures and considerations for the Xamu Wetlands field app. Our goal is to protect the integrity of the data and the privacy of our users.

---

## 1. Authentication & Authorization

- **Firebase Authentication**: We are using Firebase Authentication to manage user identities. This provides a secure, industry-standard way to handle user logins and session management.
- **Unsigned Uploads**: For image uploads, we are using Cloudinary's unsigned upload feature. This means that the app does not need to store any secret API keys, which significantly reduces the risk of a compromised key.

## 2. Data Security

- **Data in Transit**: All communication between the app and our backend services (Firebase and Cloudinary) is encrypted using HTTPS.
- **Data at Rest**: Both Firebase and Cloudinary encrypt all data at rest, providing an additional layer of security.
- **Sensitive Data**: We have taken care to not store any sensitive information, such as passwords or API keys, in the source code. The Cloudinary upload preset is the only piece of configuration that is stored in the app, and it is configured to only allow uploads to a specific folder.

## 3. Infrastructure Security

- **Firebase Security Rules**: We will implement Firebase Security Rules to control access to the Realtime Database. This will ensure that users can only read and write data that they are authorized to access.
- **Cloudinary Security**: Our Cloudinary account is configured to only allow unsigned uploads to a specific folder. This prevents a malicious user from uploading files to other parts of our account.

## 4. Future Considerations

- **Signed Uploads**: As the application grows, we may consider moving to signed uploads for Cloudinary. This would provide an additional layer of security, but would require a backend service to sign the upload requests.
- **Data Validation**: We will implement server-side data validation to ensure that only valid data is written to our database.
